# **Welcome back!** 


Today, I am discussing how the process of creating a grant for my digital humanities project is coming along...

To start my grant project, I had to devise an idea for a digital humanities project. I knew that I had to be very passionate about the subject matter for it to be an enjoyable experience for myself and the project’s users. When the creator of a project is passionate, that is reflected in their work. I am very enthusiastic about children’s literature and knew immediately that the project I decided on would have it be the main element. 

The original concept that I had for my digital humanities project was a database for teachers to utilize in the classroom to find diverse books for their students. It turned out that this idea was far too similar to other projects that already existed, so Dr. Stover advised me to focus my project on one specific children’s book. I reflected on the Children’s Literature course I took my sophomore year at Christopher Newport University and remembered how well Maurice Sendak’s children’s book, *Where the Wild Things Are*, was able to be explored in a multitude of ways. It is also a very popular book that intrigues young readers.

This led me to come up with a project that consists of an interactive website that will allow young students to thoroughly explore the Caldecott Medal-winning text. This project will be used as a resource for teachers to utilize in the classroom. This childhood favorite has endless potential in teaching children about the power of imagination, the importance of respecting loved ones, and not judging a book by its cover. Other themes, or lessons, Sendak incorporates in his somewhat didactic text include having agency, learning to let loose when life gets hard, and to love freely and fiercely.

This resource will include links around the site that will lead the user to whatever subject they wish to explore about the text. Those tabs will be linked to a story timeline feature, various lesson plans, and activities for teachers, history on the author, and information on the illustrations. These tools will help young readers engage with the text on a deeper level of understanding.

This story, having been published in 1963, has remained so popular because of its relevant themes and amazing artwork. To make the website layout as visually stimulating as the educational features are interesting, I plan on incorporating Sendak’s illustrations into the design. The background will consist of images from Max’s forest that grew in his bedroom. I also wish to have significant quotes from the book be placed throughout the website in an eye-pleasing manner. 

The story timeline, created with TimelineJS, will be a very entertaining feature that is similar to other projects that used the application. It will cover the events that take place in the book and how time in Max’s imaginative world moves at a faster pace than in the real world.

From my research, I have not been able to discover any digital humanities projects that deeply examine a children’s literature book interactively. Although, I have found sites that include timelines and images that link to further information, which helps in that regard. I plan to keep exploring and come up with more ideas to better my budding project.
