**Description**:

The World of Dante is a digital humanities project that allows the viewer to explore Dante Alighieri’s most famous work, The Divine Comedy, through different lenses. This three-part epic poem was written by Dante during the fourteenth century. This epic is known as one of the greatest works of world literature, which is why a project such as this can be useful to those who either teach or study the text often. 


The project is sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities, University of Virginia, and is funded in part by an IATH Research Fellowship, The National Endowment for the Humanities, the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, and a grant from the National Italian American Foundation.

The website’s layout and design appears to be easily navigable, as well as visually pleasing. The site opens with an image of a painting by Domenico di Michelino, La Commedia Illumina Firenze. This painting is in Florence’s Cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, and depicts Dante presenting his Divine Comedy. Around him are the three realms discussed in the poem, Inferno, Paradiso, and Purgatorio. If the left side of the image is selected, which shows the realm of Hell, it will bring the user to another page that provides information on that specific canticle, Inferno. This will happen when the scenes of Paradiso and Purgatorio are clicked as well. This makes for a very user-friendly website because images are self-explanatory tools that direct a person’s attention. 


At the bottom of the home page, a very helpful instructional video is provided by the project director, Deborah Parker. She states that the site is intended for teachers, but it can also be useful to their students, as well as any individual interested in gaining a deeper understanding of Dante’s work. 


On the top navigation bar, are the plainly stated titles of the combined text pages. If the user were to click on Inferno, they would be taken to the same page as the image of Inferno took them to. Next to the description of the canticle is a drop-down bar that will allow the user to go to any canto from that canticle. Once a canto is selected, the canto can be seen with the original Italian version next to the translated English text. This tool can be helpful to those who need the translation or who wish to see the differences made between the languages. 


In the margin on the right side of the cantos, is another drop-down list. It highlights the people, places, creatures, deities, structures, images, and music that are related to the epic poem and can provide more clarity. If the user were to select “people” and then click on Virgil’s character’s name, a description of that character pops up in a new, small window. While the provided information on the character is helpful, the added pop up window seems a bit dated. If the website designer were to make this information show up within the same window, it would be a more appealing tool to utilize. 


Another resourceful feature is the lower navigation bar that contains links to images, maps, music, a timeline, an in-text search bar, teacher resources, and an about the project page. The most useful is arguably the search bar because it allows the user to search any words they wish to find within the Comedy. If maps were to be selected, different artistic depictions of Dante’s realms will appear. The first map is Sandro Botticelli’s Chart of Hell. It becomes an interactive diagram of Hell’s nine circles when clicked on. The timeline feature is also very useful because it shows dates of significant historical events that occurred before and during Dante’s lifetime. This can reveal his influences and inspirations. This feature is easily manipulated, with the user only having to use the curser to click and drag the timeline either left or right. 


**Assessment**:


The explanation for how the digital humanities project was designed and created cannot be found on the site. Without this information, a similar project will not be made. 


The site originated in 1996, and some of the more dated qualities are obvious. They can be seen in the pop-up windows and how the content appears centered on the left side of the site instead of spread across the whole page. With these couple of updates, the World of Dante can become an even more unchallenging site to navigate and enjoy. 


Until next time!
