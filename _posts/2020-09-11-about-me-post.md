The Palmer Post

# **Hi all!** 


This is my **first post**!

My name is Carly Palmer. I am in my senior year at Christopher Newport University, a small liberal arts college in Newport News, Virginia. At my school, I am majoring in English, with a minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies. 

I decided to take the Digital Humanities course as my required writing-intensive this Fall semester because I have always been interested in writing on a digital platform. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at a local wedding planning website, that included a blog page. You can check out that blog [**here**](https://myeasternshorewedding.com/category/vendor-spotlight/).

I was responsible for covering weddings that were submitted, which entailed writing a blog post, selecting images from their photoshoots to publish, creating alt-text for those images, and linking the local wedding vendors that the couple used for their event. To advertise for the blog I wrote, I also had to post on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest. This experience helped prepare me for the DH course. 

I have always been an avid reader of books, mostly Historical Fiction, Fantasy, and Contemporary literature. I plan on getting a Master’s Degree in publishing, hopefully in the UK. This past Spring semester, I was able to study abroad in Florence, Italy, at the [Florence University of the Arts](https://fua.it/). This had been a dream of mine because of my obsession with the Renaissance.

Sadly, I was sent home early from Italy due to Covid-19 hitting, but the month and a half that I got to experience gave me the travel bug. So, I plan on heading east once more. I was recently nominated to be a Study Abroad Student Ambassador, which will allow me to encourage other CNU students to take advantage of the unique opportunity to study abroad. 

I am from a small town, named Trappe, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I definitely fit the stereotype of a true Marylander since I am a lover of crabs and Old Bay seasoning. I have an older sister who also attended CNU and just graduated in 2019, with her Master’s in Teaching. I also have two dogs, a golden retriever named Tucker and a shorkie named Oliver. 

Stay tuned to see how my story unfolds!
