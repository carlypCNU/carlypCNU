# **Welcome back!** 


This is my reflection of a **TEI coding project**!

**Introduction:**

In this post, I will be reflecting on the process of a TEI coding project. The project’s goal is to code the selected text, Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper”, according to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standards, using the Oxygen XML (Extensible Markup Language) Editor application in order to create a digital edition of the short story. I was given column 1 on page 649 to markup, which proved to be easy with the help of the Oxygen application, which allows the user to see whether or not there are any issues with the code being recorded. When first being introduced to the project I was definitely intimidated by the idea of coding since I had zero experience, but after some trial and error, and instruction from Dr. Stover, I was actually able to enjoy the tedious process. 

**Reflection:** 

The project began with each student being assigned a certain passage from “The Yellow Wall-paper”. Each section from the text was transcribed into a Google Doc by Dr. Stover, which left room for possible error, so they needed to be proofread first. I went through looking for inconsistencies, but did not find any. I proceeded to highlight any features in the column such as page beginnings, column beginnings, paragraphs, em-dashes, italics, misspelled words/mistakes, quotes, illustrations, the title, and the byline. This allowed me to have an annotated text to reference while adding the content to the Oxygen XML Editor application to code. The only feature that I was not positive about highlighting, was the semi-misspelled word, “smouldering”. It is not technically an incorrect spelling, but just the British way of spelling the word “smoldering”. I marked the word regardless in order to keep the coding consistent.

After finishing annotating, I followed Dr. Stover’s instructions on how to add the text into the Oxygen application. I needed to include every word of the text within the page tags, or in a tag in general, in order for any of it to appear in the author viewing section of the application. This author element of the application was very helpful in seeing how the coded text will appear on the site. Another helpful tool is the small box in the upper right corner of the application that will remain the color green if your code is valid, and will turn red if it is invalid.

Other tags had to be added into the places where the aforementioned features were found in the original text. Dr. Stover provided the codes needed to mark them, I just had to copy and paste them into the correct places. Another very accommodating tool that Oxygen possesses, is that it fills in the remainder of the tag that you are trying to create. Every aspect of the program is built to help those who are not very advanced when it comes to coding, making it an enjoyable process.

Overall, I was able to deftly take my transcribed passage from the original Google Doc and turn that into an encoded document. While the project seemed daunting at first, due to my lack of coding knowledge, I found myself getting absorbed into the repetitive work. This was mostly because of Oxygen’s user-friendly qualities. 


Until next time!
