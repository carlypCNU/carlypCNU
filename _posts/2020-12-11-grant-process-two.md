# **Welcome back!** 


Here's an update on how my grant project is coming along...

Since my last update on my grant process, I have viewed other digital humanities projects that are similar to what I wish to accomplish with my own. Dr. Stover recommended that I explore the websites [Hello Ruby](https://www.helloruby.com/)! and [Secret Coders](http://www.secret-coders.com/)!. Both of these sites allow for young readers and their teachers to thoroughly examine the world of the stories that inspired the project as well as educate them with lessons on the book’s subject matter (computer science). 

On the Hello Ruby website, the user is able to meet the characters of the book’s story by clicking a “meet the characters” link, which takes them to a fun and colorful page filled with descriptions, which is a great way to introduce new readers. The site also provides fun activities that will get children interested in programming. There is also a section made for teachers, to allow them to learn the basics of computer science.

The Secret Coder’s website is similar to Hello Ruby’s in that it helps kids get interested in activities like coding. It also introduces the characters in an amusing manner as well, which may be an interesting element to add to my own project. Through the intrigue of comics, famous children’s book cartoonist, Gene Luen Yang, was able to create a digital humanities project that supplies excerpts from his books, printable activities for a classroom, and step by step coding lessons that include videos. I want my project to emulate this website’s interactive and educational atmosphere.

What I did not think to include while drafting my project, was to have Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are available as a digital edition on the site. A fun reading of the story on the site, with a possible audio narration, would be very beneficial to the students who discover the project online because they would have the text readily available to explore. I would need to be given permission by the publisher, Harper Collins, in order to not commit copyright infringement, which may pose a challenge. If this were to not be made possible, the project will still be useful in its other aspects of course.  

Another element that contributes to why a digital humanities project like mine is necessary and beneficial is the fact that many students are being taught at home, via computer, due to COVID-19 making it unsafe to meet in person in many areas. Having a project where children can go online and be visually stimulated by a wholesome story, while also learning life lessons such as the importance of cherishing our loved ones, not judging a book by its cover, and the power that imagination wields. An easily accessed resource such as this will reap countless rewards for young learners and their teachers who may be struggling with what to entertain their students with while teaching virtually. It is well-known that many younger students have issues paying attention while participating in a class that is online due to everyday distractions, but a fun site that is user-friendly and discusses a kid’s favorite book will hopefully command their attention. 

My older sister, who also attended Christopher Newport University, is a third-grade teacher in Chesapeake, Virginia. I ran my idea for this project by her and she agreed that it would be a very useful learning instrument that will engage young readers during such difficult times. 

The story of Max meeting some friendly Wild Things has truly shaped the world of children’s literature forever, and this project will only help in keeping the legend live on.
